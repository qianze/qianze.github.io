She enjoys poached eggs, idyllic summer afternoons, and occasionally writing about herself in the third person.<br><br>Her art is a measure of her displacement. Born in the seaside metropolis of Dalian, China, she has since lived on the right side, left side, and middle of the United States. Her portfolio represents the resulting potpurri of personalities she has encountered in people, landscapes, and objects.|
